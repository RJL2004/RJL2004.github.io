      <article> The Dart Monkey Paragon shoots spiked balls that are around the same size of the Dart Monkey its self if the Dart Monkey is 1.2m tall the volume of the balls should be 0.9m^3. Now as darts are normally made out of Tungstun and the spiked balls seems to be made out of the same material this would mean they have a density of 19,250 kg/m3 so multipling by the volume of the balls would mean that each one has a volume of 17,325kg/m^3. Since they move around as fast as the laser projectiles there power can be determined with the formula 1/2(m)(v)^2. Which would be 1/2(17,325)(299,792,458)^2 which equals 778,546,670,000,000,000,000 joules.</article>
      <aside> As the Dart Monkey with no upgrades is relative to the Boomerang Monkey which can create a sonic boom by throwing its boomerang it should be able to fight at around the speed of sound. This would give it a combat speed of around 1234.8km/h. Now when comparing it two the Super Monkey's Lasers the darts thrown are relative in speed with a low estimate of 75% the speed of the lasers the Dart Monkey is fast enough to throw darts at 809,439,636.6km/h. Unlike Homelander this would not be the Dart Monkeys travel speed but the speed the Dart Monkey could fight. So this speed traslate more to how fast the Dart Monkey could throw attack, react to attacks and dodge compared to how fast it could run a marathon.</aside>
      <aside> The durability of th Dart Monkey is pretty simple to determine. The Ace Monkey is able to drop a Tsar Bomba on the map when this is done the Dart Monkey is complete unaffected so the Dart Monkey should be able to withstand 100 megatons of TnT or 418,400,000,000,000,000 joules. Additionally the Dart Monkeys durability is probably much higher as the Tsar Bomba has no effect at all so it would most likely take much more force to hurt the Dart Monkey.</aside>
