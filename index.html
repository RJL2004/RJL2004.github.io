  <h1 class="intro"> Dart Monkey vs Homelander </h1>
    <p class="body"> Homelander is one if not the main antagonist of the Boys. In this series he is the most powerfull Superhero by far being able tp physically dominate any other character with little to no exeption. His opponet today will be the Dart Monkey from Bloons Tower Defense. The Dart Monkey is the face of Bloons Tower Defense (BTD) and joked to be the strongest tower but will it be able to pull a victory. To determine who would come out victories I will compare there power, speed, and durability. </p> 
  
 <p> <ul class="intro"> Power of both contestants 
      <li class="intro"> Homelander Feats and Statements </li>
          <p class="body"> Homelander is been shown and stated to be much stronger than any other character in his universe so he should be able to recreate any physical feat they perform. Queen Maive was stated to be have stopped a school bus saving the children on board. A school bus when full could have a weight of 16350kg asuming its traveling at 64km/h this would be homelander could output 2,561,145.75 joules. When asked to lift a Boing 747 Homelander implies that he has the physical strenght to do so just that since he is the air he would just break through the plane. If taken as true this would mean that he is able to lift at least 100,000kg.<p>
      <li class="intro"> Dart Monkey Feats and Statements </li>
          <p class="body"> The power of the Dart Monkey is hard because of the rules and statements made in game. For example the Dart Monkey eventually able to shoot plasma power balls around the size of the monkey its self. Asuming the monkeys are 1.2 meters tall it should have a volume of 0.9m^3 and asuming its made out of tungstun its mass should be 17,325kg/m^3. The problem when determined the power of the shots comes when finding there speed because these projectiles are able to move faster than the laser projectiles of the Super Monkey and if they really are laser then that would mean they are moving faster or as fast as light. If they are moving at the speed of light then there power would be 778,546,670,000,000,000,000 joules. Although unbelieveble each on of those projectiles should be around as powerful as 1,860 Tsar Bombas. </p>
  </ul>
  <p> <ul class="intro"> Speed of both contestants 
      <li class="intro"> Homelander Feats and Statements </li>
          <p class="body"> Homelander's speed is far more straight fowared to determine than his power since he is constitanly shown to travel a couple times faster than sound. When looking for translucent he was stated to move 1.5 times the speed of sound or 1,852.2km/h. He was also shown to be able to fly faster than an F-16 which can travel at 2,175km/h. Finally his current best speed feat was when we was able to save butcher from an explosive that was already exploding. The explotion of C4 expands at 29,131.2khm/h or about 24 times the speed of sound meaning Homelnader should be able to move at least if not a bit faster than this speed. </p>
      <li class="intro"> Dart Monkey Feats and Statements </li>
          <p class="body"> There are two alterntives to take the Dart Monkeys speed. First is that the Boomerangs Monkey has the ability to create a sonic boom while throwing its boomerangs and the Dart Monkey is able to  display similar speed to this. Meaning the Dart Monkey should have a combat speed similar to the speed of sound at 1,234.8km/h. Now the other alternative is to compare it again to the lasers of the Super Monkey where is they tavel at the speed of light and the Dart Monkey is able to with no upgrades throw a dart 75% that speed the Dart Monkey should be able to move 809,439,636.6km/h. Now this wouldn't be travel speed but combat speed meaning the Dart Monkey shouldn't be able to travel this fast but react and throw attacks at this speed.</p>
  </ul>
  <p> <ul class="intro"> Durability of both contestants 
      <li class="intro"> Homelander Feats and Statements </li>
          <p class="body"> Character in the series state that no weapon on earth are strong enough to kill Homelander if taken at face value this should mean Homelander could survive the Tsar Bomba the worlds strongerst nuke. This bomb outputed could hypothetically output 100 megatons of TnT or 418,400,000,000,000,000 joules. Which comically suggest Homelander would not be able to hurt himself as he has not shown a single feat of power that even close to this.</p>
      <li class="intro"> Dart Monkey Feats and Statements </li>
          <p class="body"> The durability of the Dart Moenkey is surprisingly close the that of Homelander as in game the Ace Monkey can unlock the ability to drop the Tsar Bomba on the map. The nuke will land on the field and explode as this doesn't hurt or affect the Dart Monkey should be able to with stand the 100 megatons of TnT or 418,400,000,000,000,000 joules that Homelander could also hypothetically withsand. Technically the Dart Monkey takes the attack better as Homelander has been shown to be disoriented or stunned by loud noises while the Dart Monkey is totally unaffected.</p>
  </ul> 
      
  <h2 class="intro"> Conclusion </h2>
    <p class="body"> The information is pretty clear the Dart Monkey should absolutly and completly destroy Homelander with little to no difficulty. Even calculating the power of the dart monkey through different means to get a smaller number by comparing it to the Tsar Bomba in game gives you something stronger than anything Homelander has done. Simple put the Dart Monkey has been shown to move orders of magnitude faster and hit exponentionly harder than Homelander. Additionly in the only state where they are hypothetically relative, Homelander has only been stated to be able to survive any human weapon never being hit by anything even comparable to a Nuke and even so Homelander can't hit hard enough to hurt the Dart Monkey.</p>
