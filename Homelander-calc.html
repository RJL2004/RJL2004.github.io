      <article> To determine the force that Queen Maive would have extered on the bus we needed to find the force that the bus would be traveling with since to stop it she would have had to equal it. Weight of a schoold bus full of people can be from 16350kg to 6580kg using the high end and assuming the bus is moving at 64km/h or 17.7m/s the energy needed to stop the bus can be deterined. The formula needed is 1/2(mass) times velocity squared wich equal 2,561,145.75 joules. This would be to instatly stop the bus which most likely didn't happen but to make the fight more fair I am assuming the most out of Homelander.</article>
      <aside> To determine his speed the speed of a F-16 needed to be found which is 2,175 km/h. Now Not even including his other feats it should be assumed he could move alot faster than this as he was able to reach his destination before any F-16 could get there and they were already on there wat by the time he started traveling there. On the other hand this doesn't really matter cause his other feat blows this speed out of the water. The explotion of a C4 expands at a rate of 29,131.2khm/h or about 24 times the speed of sound and he was able to grab Butcher and take him to safty before the explotion killed him even though he was standing next to it. Now he should be able to move faster than this as Butcher was closer to the explosives than to Homelander.</aside>
        <aside> Homelanders durability was the easiest to determine in the series they clearly state that no weapon can kill Homelander. Additionally when Butcher hear that a weapon was able to kill soldier boy he states that it "must have been an H-bomb cause he is almost as stong as Homelander". So simple determine how powerfull is the biggest nuke the Tsar Bomba. After finding that it has an output of 100megatons of Tnt multiple that by 4,184,000,000,000,000 to have a standard unit as that how many joules are in one megaton of tnt.  </aside>
